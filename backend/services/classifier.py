CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT="""You are a document classification assistant.
 
Classify the document excerpt below into EXACTLY ONE of these categories:
legal, health, finance, education, research, hobbies, technology, general
 
Rules:
- legal: contracts, agreements, terms, court documents, compliance, regulations
- health: medical records, prescriptions, health reports, clinical notes
- finance: invoices, bank statements, tax documents, financial reports
- education: textbooks, syllabi, academic papers, study material, certificates
- research: scientific papers, studies, white papers, research reports
- hobbies: recipes, sports, travel, gaming, DIY, personal interests
- technology: software docs, API references, technical manuals, code documentation
- general: anything that doesn't fit the above categories
 
Respond with ONLY this JSON — no markdown, no explanation, no extra text:
{"category": "<one of the 8 categories>", "confidence": "<high|medium|low>", "reason": "<one short sentence>"}

  MAIN ENTRY POINT : will be called from the ingest router.
 
    Reads the first 1500 characters of the document text
    and asks Gemini to classify it into a category.
 
    Why only 1500 chars?
      - The category is almost always clear from the beginning
      - Using the full doc wastes tokens and costs more
      - 1500 chars ≈ ~400 tokens — fast and cheap
 
    Returns:
    {
        "category":   "legal",    categories
        "confidence": "high",     how sure Gemini is
        "reason":     "Contains contract clauses and legal terminology"
    }
 
    Never raises an exception — returns "general" as safe fallback.
